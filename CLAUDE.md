# Communities2

**Branch:** `eston/dev` — deployed to GitHub Pages

## Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Redux Toolkit + SCSS Modules
- Python blockchain contracts: `Storage()`, `master()`, `timestamp()`, `partners()` — no imports, no `.get(key, default)`
- Contract API: `contractRead()`/`contractWrite()` from `src/services/api.ts`; `deployContract()`/`joinContract()` for contracts
- Vite `?raw` suffix for importing Python contract source
- **No test framework** — verify via `npm run dev` and browser DevTools
- **Design system**: `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — component patterns, spacing, typography, mobile standards. Reference when building UI.

## Key Patterns

- `FlowProps`: `{ instanceId, collaborationId, collaborationType, parentContractId?, stageKey? }`. Flow registry uses `context: 'collab' | 'initiative'` to separate flows shown in collab menu vs pipeline.
- `useFlowContract` hook (`flows/shared/useFlowContract.ts`): returns `{ contractId, isReady, isDeploying, hasError, errorMessage, statusMessage, retry }`. Two modes:
  - **Per-user** (default): deploys a contract per user. Used by Collab flows.
  - **Shared** (`parentContractId` + `stageKey`): reads parent contract for stored sub-contract; joins if found, deploys and stores if not. All initiative dashboard flows use this so community members share one contract.
  - **Resilience**: 30s deploy timeout, stale deploying recovery on mount, cancellation-safe. Diagnostic logs prefixed `[FlowContract]`.
- `flowContractsSlice` (`flows/shared/flowContractsSlice.ts`): localStorage-backed contract ID cache
- `preferencesSlice` (`store/slices/preferencesSlice.ts`): localStorage-backed starred/hidden community IDs
- `useSwipeRef` (`hooks/useSwipeNavigation.ts`): callback ref for horizontal swipe
- Profiles at `state.communities.profiles[publicKey]`; fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `userPhoto`, `userBio`, `country?`
- Auth at `state.user.serverUrl`/`publicKey`
- Country utilities: `src/utils/countries.ts` — 197 countries (ISO 3166-1), `getCountryByCode()`, `getCountryColor()`, `getCountryName()`, `getCountryFlag()`
- `CountryParticipation` (`components/shared/CountryParticipation.tsx`): shows top country flags with participation counts
- `SearchableSelect` (`components/shared/SearchableSelect.tsx`): reusable searchable dropdown

## App Structure

**Navigation**: Global footer (`StageFooter.tsx`) — fixed bottom bar with 5 stage icons (Problem, Discussion, Proposals, Vote, Mandate), navigates to `/stage/:stageId`, appears on all authenticated pages. `HomepageMenu` (slide-out) provides access to Profile, Communities, Join, Create, About, Contact.

**Stage Feed Mini-Apps** (`StageFeedView.tsx`): Default landing page at `/stage/problem`. Each stage is a purpose-built participation interface. Problem: inline up/down voting with optimistic UI + threshold bars. Discussion: tap-through cards to initiative discussion view. Proposals: inline `ApprovalFlow` with approve/withdraw per card. Vote: inline `QVFlow` with credit allocation per card. Mandate: inline `ConvictionStaking` with conviction staking per card. Sample data shown as empty-state fallback only.

**Community** (`CommunityView.tsx`): Dark header with name, description, member count. No inline tab bar — all navigation through slide-out hamburger menu (Home, Create Initiative, Collab, Chat, Currency, Members, Identity & Trust, Share, Invite, Leave). Default view is the activity feed with "Community Activity" section header showing initiatives with stage badges.

**Initiative Dashboard** (`InitiativeDashboard.tsx`): Full 5-stage overview when clicking an initiative. Progress bar (green=completed, blue=active, grey=locked). Vertically stacked stage cards:
- Completed stages: metrics summary, "Completed" badge
- Active voting stages (Problem, Proposals, Vote, Mandate): interactive flows rendered inline
- Active Discussion: summary + "Join Discussion" button → dedicated `DiscussionStageView`
- Locked stages: greyed out, "Awaiting earlier stages"
- Advance bar at bottom with threshold checks and confirm/cancel
- All stage flows use shared contracts via `parentContractId={collaborationId}`
- `ConvictionStaking` flow for mandate stage: time-weighted staking with duration multipliers (1w=1x to 1y=12x), country breakdown

**Identity** (`IdentityView.tsx`): At `/identity/*`, default `/identity/communities`. Communities list with "Your Communities" title/description, single-column cards with description, member count (Users icon), mandate count (ScrollText icon), star/hide controls (high-contrast buttons), and "Create a community" dashed card linking to `/create-community`. Profile page with identity info hints. Join page with tutorial text. About, Contact pages.

**Create Initiative** (`CreateInitiativePage.tsx`): Full onboarding page at `/community/:communityId/create-initiative`. Educates users with "What is an Initiative?", 5-stage stepper, tips, then form (title, description, evidence URLs, countries). Replaces the old `CreateInitiativeDialog` modal.

**Create Community** (`CreateCommunityPage.tsx`): Full onboarding page at `/create-community`. Explains communities, features, then form (name, description). Replaces the old `CreateCommunityDialog` modal.

**Identity & Trust** (`IdentityTrust.tsx`): Dedicated page at `/community/:communityId/identity`. QR-based identity verification, ID cards, sharing. Extracted from Members page.

**Collab**: Template-based workspaces via `CollaborationPage`. Navigates from community collab tab to `/community/:communityId/collab/:collabId`. Templates in `collabTemplates.ts`. Per-user contracts.

**Chat**: `ChatTopicList` + `ChatTopic` in `community/chat/`. In-memory only (ephemeral, lost on refresh). Defensive try-catch in `chatApi.ts`.

**Currency**: Balance display, send payment, median-voted mint/burn preferences. Explainer card at top. Single-column card layout.

## Routing

```
/ → /stage/problem (redirect)
/stage/:stageId → StageFeedView
/identity/* → IdentityView (communities, profile, join, about, contact)
/create-community → CreateCommunityPage (full onboarding page)
/community/:communityId/* → CommunityView (feed, collab, collab/:collabId, chat, chat/:topicId, currency, members, identity, create-initiative)
/initiative/:host/:agent/:communityId/:initiativeId/* → InitiativeView → InitiativeDashboard
/initiative/:host/:agent/:communityId/:initiativeId/discussion → DiscussionStageView
```

## Flows

**Blockchain-backed** (contract methods match Python ↔ TypeScript):
1. **ProblemVoteFlow** — upvote/downvote with tally + threshold progress bar
2. **DiscussionFlow** — threaded comments, participation threshold
3. **ApprovalFlow** — proposals + approve/withdraw + country-segmented results
4. **QVFlow** — proposals + credit allocation + sqrt voting + results
5. **ConvictionStaking** — time-weighted conviction staking for mandates, country breakdown. Contract: `conviction_contract.py`.
6. **ConcernsFlow** — raise concerns, propose resolutions, author resolves (removed from pipeline UI, component retained)
7. **ModificationSuggestions** — suggest changes to title/description, community votes, original author accept/reject. Used in Discussion (Stage 2) and Proposals (Stage 3). Contract: `modification_contract.py`.

**Local (in-memory)**: Discussion, Document, Q&A, Roles, Scheduling, Taskboard — keyed by `instanceId`

**AI Tools** (`components/shared/AITools.tsx`): `TranslateButton` (12 languages via OpenAI API), `SummaryButton` (discussion summarizer), `AIToolbar` (combined). Requires OpenAI API key in user profile. Shows key hint icon if no key set. Service layer in `services/ai.ts`.

**Shared UI**: `EarthFlag` (`components/shared/EarthFlag.tsx`) — International Flag of Planet Earth SVG (flower of life pattern), used in `PageHeader` as logo.

## Deployment

- GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on push to `eston/dev`
- `public/404.html` handles SPA deep-link routing
- **Production build runs `tsc -b`** — fix all TS errors before pushing
- Contracts are immutable after deploy — new methods require new communities

## Recent Changes (2026-04-20)

**Initiative Dashboard & Stage Feed Mini-Apps** — spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-10-initiative-dashboard-stage-feeds-design.md`, plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-10-initiative-dashboard-stage-feeds.md`.

What shipped:
- `PipelineView` replaced by `InitiativeDashboard` as the default initiative view — shows all 5 stages at once with inline voting flows for active stages
- `DiscussionStageView` created as dedicated sub-view for threaded discussion (navigated from dashboard)
- `ConcernsFlow` disconnected from pipeline UI (component files retained)
- `ConvictionStaking` flow + `conviction_contract.py` — new time-weighted staking system for mandate stage
- `CountryParticipation` shared component for country flag display
- `StageFeedView` redesigned as 5 mini-apps with inline `ApprovalFlow`, `QVFlow`, `ConvictionStaking` per card
- Problem vote buttons now have optimistic UI updates + press animations
- Test data auto-seeding for communities with "test" in name (5 initiatives, one per stage)

## Architecture Learnings

- **Flow components are reusable across contexts**: `ApprovalFlow`, `QVFlow`, `ProblemVoteFlow`, and `ConvictionStaking` work both in the Initiative Dashboard (expanded) and in StageFeedView cards (compact). The `compact` prop on `ConvictionStaking` controls density. Other flows adapt naturally.
- **Shared contract mode is the standard for initiative flows**: All initiative stage flows use `parentContractId={collaborationId}` + `stageKey` to share one contract per stage across all community members. Per-user mode is only for Collab workspaces.
- **`deployContract` return value handling**: Returns either `{ id: string }` object or a plain string. Pattern: `const id = (response as { id?: string }).id || (response as string)`.
- **Optimistic UI pattern**: Snapshot state before async write, update UI immediately, rollback on error. Used in ProblemVoteFlow and StageFeedView inline voting.
- **Route sub-views via pathname check**: `InitiativeView` checks `location.pathname.endsWith('/discussion')` to render `DiscussionStageView` vs `InitiativeDashboard` — no extra route entries needed since the parent route uses `/*` wildcard.

## Known Limitations

- **Collab contracts are per-user** — need shared mode (like Pipeline) to be truly collaborative
- **Completed stage metrics** — Initiative Dashboard only shows problem tally for completed stages; discussion/proposals/vote completed summaries not yet fetched
- **Test data seeding** — auto-seeds 5 initiatives in communities with "test" in name on first load
- **Top 3 carry-over** from Proposals → Vote not yet implemented
- **Chat is ephemeral** — in-memory only, lost on refresh
- **Modification Suggestions author-decide**: `originalAuthor` prop not yet wired — author accept/reject buttons won't show until initiative contract stores author in details
